# terraform-azurerm-avm-template

This is a template repo for Terraform Azure Verified Modules.

Things to do:

1. Set up a GitHub repo environment called `test`.
1. Configure environment protection rule to ensure that approval is required before deploying to this environment.
1. Create a user-assigned managed identity in your test subscription.
1. Create a role assignment for the managed identity on your test subscription, use the minimum required role.
1. Configure federated identity credentials on the user assigned managed identity. Use the GitHub environment.
1. Search and update TODOs within the code and remove the TODO comments once complete.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As the overall AVM framework is not GA (generally available) yet - the CI framework and test automation is not fully functional and implemented across all supported languages yet - breaking changes are expected, and additional customer feedback is yet to be gathered and incorporated. Hence, modules **MUST NOT** be published at version `1.0.0` or higher at this time.
>
> All module **MUST** be published as a pre-release version (e.g., `0.1.0`, `0.1.1`, `0.2.0`, etc.) until the AVM framework becomes GA.
>
> However, it is important to note that this **DOES NOT** mean that the modules cannot be consumed and utilized. They **CAN** be leveraged in all types of environments (dev, test, prod etc.). Consumers can treat them just like any other IaC module and raise issues or feature requests against them as they learn from the usage of the module. Consumers should also read the release notes for each version, if considering updating to a more recent version of a module to see if there are any considerations or breaking changes etc.

## Required Inputs

The following input variables are required:

### <a name="input_name"></a> [name](#input\_name)

Description: (Required) Specifies the name of the Route Table. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

Type: `string`

### <a name="input_resource_group_name"></a> [resource\_group\_name](#input\_resource\_group\_name)

Description: (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the resource. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

Type: `string`

## Optional Inputs

The following input variables are optional (have default values):

### <a name="input_disable_bgp_route_propagation"></a> [disable\_bgp\_route\_propagation](#input\_disable\_bgp\_route\_propagation)

Description: (Optional) Boolean flag which controls propagation of routes learned by BGP on that route table. True means disable.

Type: `bool`

Default: `true`

### <a name="input_enable_telemetry"></a> [enable\_telemetry](#input\_enable\_telemetry)

Description: This variable controls whether or not telemetry is enabled for the module.  
For more information see <https://aka.ms/avm/telemetryinfo>.  
If it is set to false, then no telemetry will be collected.

Type: `bool`

Default: `true`

### <a name="input_location"></a> [location](#input\_location)

Description: Azure region where the resource should be deployed.  If null, the location will be inferred from the resource group location.

Type: `string`

Default: `null`

### <a name="input_lock"></a> [lock](#input\_lock)

Description: The lock level to apply. Default is `None`. Possible values are `None`, `CanNotDelete`, and `ReadOnly`.

Type:

```hcl
object({
    name = optional(string, null)
    kind = optional(string, "None")
  })
```

Default: `{}`

### <a name="input_role_assignments"></a> [role\_assignments](#input\_role\_assignments)

Description:   A map of role assignments to create on the Route Table. The map key is deliberately arbitrary to avoid issues where map keys maybe unknown at plan time.

  - `role_definition_id_or_name` - (Required) The Scoped-ID of the Role Definition or the name of a built-in Role. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
  - `principal_id` - (Required) The ID of the Principal (User, Group or Service Principal) to assign the Role Definition to. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
  - `principal_type` - (Optional) The type of the principal\_id. Possible values are User, Group and ServicePrincipal. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
  - `description` - (Optional) The description for this Role Assignment. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
  - `skip_service_principal_aad_check` - (Optional) If the principal\_id is a newly provisioned Service Principal set this value to true to skip the Azure Active Directory check which may fail due to replication lag. This argument is only valid if the principal\_id is a Service Principal identity. Defaults to false.
  - `condition` - (Optional) The condition that limits the resources that the role can be assigned to. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
  - `condition_version` - (Optional) The version of the condition. Possible values are 1.0 or 2.0. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

  > Note: only set `skip_service_principal_aad_check` to true if you are assigning a role to a service principal.

Type:

```hcl
list(object({
    role_definition_id                     = optional(string, null)
